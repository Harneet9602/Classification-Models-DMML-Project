 DMML Classifiers and Evaluation

This repository contains a multi-part classification project built as part of the Data Mining and Machine Learning (DMML) course. It focuses on solving a real-world binary classification problem using multiple supervised learning models and evaluation metrics.

The project walks through data preprocessing, model training, validation, and performance comparison using Scikit-learn.


 ðŸ“š Contents
